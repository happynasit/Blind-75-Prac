Number of Suitable Locations
ðŸ”¥ FULLTIME
Amazon has multiple delivery centers and delivery warehouses all over the world! The world is represented by a number line from -109 to 109. 
There are n delivery centers, the ith one at location center[i]. A location x is called a suitable location for a warehouse if it is possible to bring 
all the products to that point by traveling a distance of no more than d. At any one time, products can be brought from one delivery center and placed at 
point x. Given the positions of n delivery centers, calculate the number of suitable locations in the world. That is, calculate the number of points x on the 
number line (-109 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 109) where the travel distance required to bring all the products to that point is less than or equal to d.
Note: The distance between point x and center[i] is |x - center[i]|, their absolute difference
